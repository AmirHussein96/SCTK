SCTK Version: 2.2.4

asclite memory usage update.

This directory contains SCTK, the NIST Scoring Toolkit.  SCTK contains
the source code, documentation and example data for the following
programs:

	sclite   V2.3 - "Score Lite",
	sc_stats V1.2 - sclite's Statistical Significance Comparison tool
	rover    V0.1 - Recognition Output Voting Error Reduction
	asclite  V1.4 - Multidimensional alignment replacement for sclite

The distribution was initially written in ANSI C on a SUN Workstation.  To
date, The code has been successfully compiled and tested on the
following platforms:

	* compiled with warning messages, but successful self test
	** compiled and ran, but test6, which uses GNU's diff for
           alignment fails.  The use of DIFF for alignment is rarely
           used and the failure can be safely ignored.

Read install.txt to compile and install the package.  UNIX-style
manual pages and 'HTML' formatted manuals are provided in the 'doc'
directory.

			  Bundled Software:

This version of SCTK includes the CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language
Modeling Toolkit v2.  Included in STCK is the complete source code
tree and documentation.  The toolkit has been included so that SCLITE
can use a language model to compute conditional word weights for
word-weighted scoring.


			  Optional Software:

To use the interactive installation for sclite, edit the file
src/sclite/config.sh at line 36, set the user_interaction=1 it will
ask you during the configuration (make config) if you want to use
GNU diff instead of sclite and CMU-Cambridge SLM for sclite.
Those choices are not recommended and not used anymore.

Sclite has the ability to use GNU's "diff" utility as an alternate 
string alignment method.  The installer has the choice whether or not
to include this ability in the compiled version.  

If the use of GNU's "diff" is desired, you will need GNU's "diff"
utility from their "diffutils" distribution version 2.7.  If you can
not locate this distribution, it is available via anonymous ftp from
the jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov server.  The compressed tar file
'diffutils-2.7.tar.Z' is located in the 'pub' directory.  When you
install diff, make sure the executable is installed as: "gdiff",
"gnudiff" or "diffgnu".  The 'config.sh' script expects it to be
called one of these.

Special Note to SGI owners: When installing GNU's "diff" make sure to
call it "gnudiff" or "diffgnu", if you use "gdiff" the executable name
may be overshadowed by a pre-existing executable.

utf_filt is using SGML external software and modules like SGMLS perl 
module and nsgmls program which have be updated and continued: OpenSP
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2115&package_id=2869).
The version v1.5.2 of OpenSP have been tested and working with the 
current version of utf_filt.

Asclite can be compiled into 64 bit if you had -m64 on the 
src/asclite/core/makefile and src/asclite/test/makefile file to CFLAGS 
variable.
If you do not compile in 64 bits you can add a fail safe into the command
line by adding -difficulty-limit 3.
