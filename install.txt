SCTK Basic Installation for Version 1.3
=======================================

*****  If you have extracted this package off of a CDROM, on some   *****
*****  systems, the main makefile will have a period appended to    *****
*****  the filename.  If this has occurred, please rename the       *****
*****  makefile without the trailing period.                        *****

To install compile and install sctk, from the main directory
type the commands:

	% make config
	% make 
	% make check
	% make install

The 'make config' command exeuctes the script 'config.sh' in the src
directory.  The script probes the installation system and creates a
makefile based on the probe.  For typical installations, the default
execution of the script will be statisfactory.  See the description of
'config.sh' in the file 'src/config.txt'.  Note that you'll be asked
if you want to enable alignments via GNU Diff.  The GNU Diff
alignments do not work with Version 2.8.1 of diff.  To avoid
unnecessary installation complications, not including the
functionality is prudent.

The 'make' command will compile all toolkit executables and libraries.

The 'make check' will perform self tests on the toolkit.  Please
report any problems to Jon Fiscus at NIST with any bug reports or
comments at the email address jonathan.fiscus@nist.gov or by phone,
(301)-975-3182.  Please include the version number of rover, and any
other relevant information such as OS, compiler, etc.  

The 'make install' command will copy the executables to
/usr/local/bin, and the manual pages to /usr/local/man.  You can
specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`config.sh' the option `--prefix=PATH' manually.  See 'src/config.txt'
for further details.
