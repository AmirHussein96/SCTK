20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 wolf_blitzer 738.919000 749.465000 IS THERE ANY WORKING ASSUMPTION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT I KNOW THEY ARE BEING AIDED BY THE F. B. I. A. T. F. ALCOHOL TOBACCO FIRE ARMS IS THERE A WORKING ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS ONE SHOOTER OR MULTIPLE SHOOTERS
20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 bruce_cadwallader 749.465000 771.782000 WORKING ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT IS ONE PERSON BUT NO ONE HAS SEEN THIS SHOOTING THIS SHOOTER AND HE HAS OR SHE HAS ACTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY AND DIFFERENT DAYS OF THE WEEK THEY ARE IN CONTACT WITH AN F. B. I. PROFILER DAILY AND THEY ARE RELUCTANT FRANKLY TO GIVE OUT MANY DETAILS THAT THEY HAVE
20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 wolf_blitzer 771.782000 807.745000 (AN-) AND I KNOW THEY ARE ALSO GETTING SOME ASSISTANCE WE SPOKE TO A MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND COUNTY EXECUTIVE ON THIS PROGRAM YESTERDAY THEY HAVE SENT AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM THE GREATER WASHINGTON AREA OUT TO COLUMBUS TO HELP OUT (%HESITATION) MAYBE SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED IN WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS AREA A YEAR AGO MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR AUTHORITIES OUT THERE BRUCE IF YOU DO NOT MIND WE HAVE SOME E. MAIL FROM OUR VIEWERS WHO WHO HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON THIS STORY WHICH IS RESONATING WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THIS FROM SHAMIEL IN MARYLAND ARE THE OHIO SHOOTINGS CONSIDERED A COPY CAT OF THE D. C. SNIPER SHOOTINGS OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW DOES IT AFFECT THE OHIO CASE IF IT IS A COPY CAT
20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 bruce_cadwallader 807.745000 833.479000 AUTHORITIES HERE THINK IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE D. C. SNIPER CASE BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT BEING TARGETED AS THEY STAND UP OUTSIDE THEIR CAR OR AT RESTAURANTS IN THIS CASE ELEVEN OF THE TWELVE CONFIRMED SHOOTINGS HAVE BEEN AT VEHICLES ONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW WAS AT A (B-) A SCHOOL BUT THAT SCHOOL WAS EMPTY ON A HOLIDAY SO IT IS

20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 wolf_blitzer 834.857000 869.959000 SO IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE SHOOTER WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO KILL SOMEONE JUST SHOOTING AT AT CARS OR AT A EMPTY SCHOOL (%HESITATION) WE DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE OBVIOUSLY (LET-) LET US GET ANOTHER E.

20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 bruce_cadwallader 869.959000 896.410000 ACTUALLY (%HESITATION) FRONT PAGE OF OUR PAPER YESTERDAY WE CALLED IT THE SNIPER SHOOTINGS (%HESITATION) AND AS YOU KNOW A SNIPER IS JUST ANYONE WHO SHOOTS FROM A HIDDEN POSITION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES REFER (I-) REFUSE TO USE THAT TERM THOUGH BECAUSE THEY THINK IT CONNOTATES A MILITARY MARKSMAN OR SOMEONE WEARING CAMOUFLAGE GEAR (%HESITATION) BUT THEY JUST DO NOT KNOW AND THEY ADMIT THEY DO NOT KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS PERSON AND (%HESITATION) THEY JUST DO NOT WANT TO GO THAT WAY YET
20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 wolf_blitzer 896.410000 931.143000 THEY DO NOT WANT TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES THAT COULD GET THE PUBLIC OFF TRACK WHICH OF COURSE HAPPENED IN THE GREATER WASHINGTON AREA WHEN THEY SAID LOOK FOR A WHITE VAN A WHITE BOX TRUCK THAT OF COURSE NEVER REALLY EXISTED IN THE INCIDENT HERE HERE IS ANOTHER E. MAIL FROM FRED IN OHIO (B-) (%HESITATION) BRUCE SEE WHAT YOU (C-) THINK ABOUT THIS MY DAUGHTERS LIVE AND WORK IN COLUMBUS I AM CONCERNED THAT ALL THE MEDIA HYPE ABOUT THE I. TWO SEVENTY SHOOTINGS ARE ONLY INCREASING LOCAL PANIC AND GIVING THE SNIPER EXACTLY THE KIND OF THRILL HE OR SHE IS LOOKING FOR IF THE MEDIA IS NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION IT MIGHT BE PART OF THE PROBLEM (%HESITATION) YOU PROBABLY HEAR SOME OF THAT IN COLUMBUS AS WELL DO NOT YOU

20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 george_w_bush 1330.738000 1351.812000 AND I LISTENED TO AN (INA-) INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION REPORT ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT (%HESITATION) STEEL IMPORTS WERE HAVING UPON OUR IMPORTANT INDUSTRY I ACTED I ACTED TO GIVE THE STEEL INDUSTRY TIME TO ADJUST I ACTED (I-) IN TIME FOR US TO SAY TO THE WORLD THAT WE WILL TRADE BUT WE WANT TO TRADE IN A FAIR WAY
20031204_130035_cnn_eng 1 dana_bash 1351.812000 1405.499000 NOW PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A WRENCHING DECISION HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE IS BECAUSE THE FLEDGLING STEEL INDUSTRY IS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN SOME KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AND THAT INCLUDES PENNSYLVANIA WEST VIRGINIA AND OHIO BUT THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (%HESITATION) (HA-) SAID THAT THESE TARIFFS THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PUT IN PLACE WERE ILLEGAL SO THE E. U. AND OTHER TRADING PARTNERS WERE WARNING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SLAP SOME OF THEIR OWN TARIFFS ON THE UNITES STATES (%HESITATION) THAT WOULD HAVE HURT THE (%HESITATION) WHITE HOUSE HAS CONCLUDED THE ECONOMY AT LARGE AND THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO TURN THIS BACK NOW ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT (%HESITATION) THAT (I-) THE ECONOMY HAS GOTTEN BETTER OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS THAT THE STEEL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN GIVEN TIME TO REGROUP AND THEY ARE ALSO LIKELY WOLF TO SAY (%HESITATION) THAT THEY ARE GOING TO (TR-) TRY TO PROMISE TO CUSHION THE BLOW FOR STEEL (IN-) THE STEEL INDUSTRY BY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IMPORTED STEEL IS NOT SOLD AT LOWER PRICES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD

VARON THEY ARE GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE CIVIL WAR BUT PRIMARILY RIGHT AFTER IN THAT TRANSITION PERIOD KNOWN AS THE RECONSTRUCTION (%HESITATION) I TOLD THEM THAT ONLY LAST YEAR I DISCOVERED THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER (%HESITATION) GEORGE DURHAM WAS A UNION SYMPATHIZER I HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THINK THAT HE WAS A CONFEDERATE BLUE (Y-) TRUE GRAY AND AND SO (%HESITATION) AND IN MY OWN WRITING ABOUT NASHVILLE AND SUMNER COUNTY DURING THE CIVIL WAR I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THERE WERE A (L-) SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT CONFEDERATES SO WE ARE GOING TO HEAR TODAY FROM (%HESITATION) JAMES BAGGETT FIRST TALKING ABOUT HIS BOOK THE SCALAWAGS AND THEN HE WILL BE FOLLOWED BY ELIZABETH VARON WHO WILL TALK ABOUT (%HESITATION) SOUTHERN LADY YANKEE SPY AND (%HESITATION) THEN WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN THE (%HESITATION) APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MINUTES THEREAFTER SO JIM BAGGETT
20031206_163852_cspan_eng 1 james_alex_baggett 80.014000 1203.307000 (%HESITATION) THANK YOU MISTER DURHAM SCALAWAG IS AN OLD WORD IT DERIVED FROM THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS AND WAS USED BY THE SCOTS IN THE SHETLAND ISLANDS FOR INFERIOR LIVESTOCK AND IT CAME TO BE USED FOR (S-) SUPPOSEDLY INFERIOR HUMAN BEINGS (%HESITATION) RASCALS (%HESITATION) ROGUES (%HESITATION) PEOPLE WHO WERE WEAK SHIFTLESS AND IT KEPT THAT MEANING RIGHT UP UNTIL THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES WHEN IT (%HESITATION) GOT ANOTHER MEANING IT CAME TO MEAN (%HESITATION) WIDELY AND EXCLUSIVELY WHITE SOUTHERN REPUBLICANS PEOPLE WHO WERE EITHER BORN IN THE SOUTH (%HESITATION) OR (%HESITATION) WHO HAD LIVED FOR A LONG TIME IN THE SOUTH AND BECAME REPUBLICANS THE SUBJECT OF MY BOOK IS THE ORIGINS OF THESE REPUBLICANS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATION BUT MOSTLY WHAT PREDISPOSED THEM TO BECOME REPUBLICANS WHEN MOST OF THE SOUTH WAS QUICKLY BECOMING A ONE PARTY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY AND WOULD BE (%HESITATION) FOR THREE QUARTERS OF THE CENTURY (%HESITATION) THEREAFTER ALTHOUGH THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN TENNESSEE BY THE WAY AS SOME OF YOU WELL KNOW WHEN I THINK OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH PEOPLE FROM EAST TENNESSEE PROBABLY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY SUBJECT (%HESITATION) BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE HOW DID I GO ABOUT FINDING OUT ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS WELL (%HESITATION) IN LOOKING AT OLDER BOOKS YOU FIND TWO OR THREE EXAMPLES USUALLY VERY NEGATIVE EXAMPLES SO I DECIDED TO EXAMINE A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM TO TRY TO GET CLOSER TO THE TRUTH AND I FINALLY ARRIVED (%HESITATION) %HESITATION AT FIGURE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT I COULD FIND INFORMATION ON SO IT IS A COLLECTIVE BIOGRAPHY APPROACH I USED A WELL DEFINED UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE PROFESSORS THAT I STUDIED WITH SAID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS YOU KNOW IF YOU COMPARE GOVERNORS AND COUNTY JUDGES YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PROVE VERY MUCH SO I DID DEFINE THEM AS HIGH RANKING OFFICEHOLDERS AND HIGH PARTY OFFICIALS I USED A UNIFORM SET OF QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED OF EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WAS THEIR SECESSION STAND WHAT DID THEY DO DURING THE WAR WHY DID THEY JOIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT A CERTAIN TIME AND SO FORTH NOW ANOTHER THING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN DOING A COLLECTIVE BIOGRAPHY IS THAT YOU HAVE A CONTROL GROUP BECAUSE SOME OF THE EARLY (%HESITATION) PRACTITIONERS OF COLLECTIVE BIOGRAPHY DID NOT HAVE A (C-) CONTROL GROUP AND OTHER SCHOLARS (%HESITATION) STUDYING WHAT THEY HAD DONE SAID WELL THIS GROUP THAT OPPOSED THEM THEY LOOKED THE SAME WHITE LAWYERS ALL ABOUT THE SAME SO YOU MUST LOOK AT ANOTHER GROUP AND I LOOKED AT THE REDEEMER DEMOCRATS WHO OPPOSED THEM AND LATER (%HESITATION) REPLACED THEM I DO AN ANALYSIS NOT ONLY OF STATE BY STATE THAT IS COMPARING THE (RE-) (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) REDEEMER DEMOCRATS IN TENNESSEE (%HESITATION) WITH THE REPUBLICANS IN TENNESSEE BUT I ALSO DO AN ANALYSIS BY REGIONS (%HESITATION) THE UPPER SOUTH (%HESITATION) WHERE THE PICTURE IS MUCH CLEARER (%HESITATION) THE SOUTHEAST WHERE IT IS MIGHTY MUDDY AND THE SOUTH WEST WHICH IS A LITTLE CLEARER (%HESITATION) THAN THE SOUTHEAST MY STUDY GOES BEYOND THE STATISTICAL STUDY I KNOW THAT (%HESITATION) READING (CA-) STATISTICS CAN BE RATHER DRY SO THIS IS MY FRAMEWORK THIS IS WHAT I HAVE THAT CREATES THIS BIOGRAPHICAL OR (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) BIOGRAPHY (%HESITATION) PROFILE BUT I DO USE THE LETTERS LETTERS FROM (%HESITATION) ARCHIVES IN (%HESITATION) ELEVEN STATES AND MANY UNIVERSITIES AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES YOU (MUS-) SEE I DO NOT CARE WHAT A (S-) HISTORIAN STUDIES THEY MUST SATURATE THEMSELVES IN THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THEY ARE WRITING ABOUT THE NUMBERS DO NOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THE HISTORIAN MUST SPEAK FOR (TH-) WHAT EVER NUMBERS HE HAPPENS TO HAVE AND WE HOPE HE HAS SOME NUMBERS TO BACK UP WHAT HE IS SAYING THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY IS FROM THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES (%HESITATION) TO THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES I LOOK AT THE PREWAR (%HESITATION) BACKGROUND OF THESE INDIVIDUALS (%HESITATION) PARTICULARLY THEIR COMMUNITY STATUS THEIR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND THEIR SECESSION STAND I LOOK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP DURING THE WAR (%HESITATION) TO THE CONFEDERACY AND THEN I LOOK AT THEIR POSTWAR (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) LIFE IN HELPING TO CREATE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE SOUTHERN STATES HERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED I (S-) MENTIONED A (%HESITATION) UNIFORM SET OF QUESTIONS I LOOK AT THEIR PREWAR SOCIAL STATUS THEIR POLITICAL AFFILIATION THEIR UNION STAND (%HESITATION) THE ROLE OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY COALITIONS BECAUSE THIS WAS AMERICANS WERE BUILDING POLITICAL COALITIONS AND THIS REMAINS TRUE TODAY AND THOSE COALITIONS DO NOT ALWAYS FIT TOGETHER SO NEATLY DO THEY (%HESITATION) THEY CAN SEEM ALMOST ABSURD AT TIMES (%HESITATION) BUT IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE JOIN A PARTY BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT PARTY CAN GET THEM (BER-) BETTER (%HESITATION) THAN ANOTHER PARTY AND WE ARE LARGELY (%HESITATION) HAVE ALWAYS BEEN (%HESITATION) FROM THE WASHINGTON ADMINISTRATION A TWO PARTY SYSTEM SO THOSE COALITIONS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY WERE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CONFEDERACY ITSELF (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) OUTSIDE OF A (F-) (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) (S-) A FEW STATES DID NOT HAVE POLITICAL PARTIES THEY SAID WE HAVE TO ALL JOIN TOGETHER FOR THE WAR AND LET US PUT POLITICS ASIDE SO IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHY (D-) (S-) SOMEONE DID SOMETHING LATER ON YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES AND FIND OUT QUITE A BIT YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE COALITIONS AND HOW MEN THAT WOULD HAD WORKED TOGETHER FORMERLY (%HESITATION) GOT BACK TOGETHER THE (R-) (%HESITATION) REACTION TO SECESSION AND WAR (%HESITATION) THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY SECESSION BECAUSE THAT FACT STANDS OUT MORE THAN ANY STUDY ANYTHING THAT ELSE THAT I STUDIED HOW ONE STOOD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE ON THE SECESSION VOTE THEN THE REACTION TO THE CONFEDERACY THE RESISTANCE THAT WAS GOING ON (%HESITATION) THE SECRET SOCIETIES THAT EXISTED SUCH AS THE HEROES OF AMERICA IN NORTH CAROLINA THE PEACE (%HESITATION) PARTY SUPPORTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA IN GEORGIA IN ALABAMA REFUGEES BY THE HUNDREDS NOW MANY OF THESE WERE OF COURSE NORTHERNERS AND A SCALAWAG CAN BE A NORTHERNER BY THE WAY IF HE LIVED IN THE SOUTH BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THEN HE IS COUNTED AS A SCALAWAG INSTEAD OF A CARPETBAGGER (%HESITATION) AND THEY HAD SUDDEN (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) CERTAIN CITIES THAT WERE CITIES OF REFUGE (B-) (%HESITATION) IN FACT MISTER DURHAM HAS WRITTEN THOROUGHLY ABOUT ONE OF THOSE CITIES OF REFUGE IT WAS CALLED NASHVILLE (%HESITATION) WHERE THE FEDERAL HAD OCCUPIED FROM EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO (%HESITATION) TO EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE THEN I ALSO LOOK AT THE LOYALIST UNDERGROUND (%HESITATION) SUCH AS PROFESSOR VARON IS CONCERNED WITH I LOOK AT (%HESITATION) RICHMOND AND (%HESITATION) SOME OF THE OTHER CITIES SUCH AS AUSTIN (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) MONTGOMERY %HESITATION COLUMBUS GEORGIA (%HESITATION) MOBILE (%HESITATION) ATLANTA THERE HAS BEEN A BOOK ON ATLANTA SHOWING THAT DEFINITELY THOSE MEN IN THE ATLANTA UNDERGROUND BECAME REPUBLICANS (%HESITATION) FOLLOWING (%HESITATION) THE CIVIL WAR NOW HERE ARE ANSWERS TO JUST A FEW OF THESE QUESTIONS I WILL NOT (M-) MENTION NEAR ALL THAT I COVERED (%HESITATION) BUT WHAT ABOUT SLAVERY AND SCALAWAGS WERE (SLA-) (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) WERE SCALAWAGS ANTI (S-) (%HESITATION) SLAVERY NO THEY WERE NOT ONLY ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY SCALAWAGS THAT I STUDIED (%HESITATION) OPPOSED SLAVERY THAT IS VOCALLY SAID SOMETHING AGAINST IT AND THESE WERE MOSTLY FREE SOILERS IN NORTH CAROLINA (%HESITATION) QUAKERS (%HESITATION) IN VIRGINIA (%HESITATION) AND A FEW FREE SOILERS THERE AS WELL AND GERMAN AMERICANS (%HESITATION) MOSTLY IN TEXAS THOSE WERE PRIMARILY (%HESITATION) THE FOLKS THAT SAID (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) THEY WERE AGAINST SLAVERY AND THEY BECAME REPUBLICANS PARTLY (%HESITATION) AS A RESULT OF THAT SCALAWAGS OWNED SLAVES ONE HALF OF SCALAWAGS OWNED SLAVES THAT COMPARES WITH TWO THIRDS OF THE REDEEMERS WHAT ABOUT EDUCATION THEY ARE OFTEN ACCUSED OF BEING UNEDUCATED (%HESITATION) POOR NE'ER DO WELLS WELL THEY WERE NOT AS EDUCATED AS WELL AS THE REDEEMERS THIS IS TRUE (%HESITATION) BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE REDEEMERS (%HESITATION) OFTEN THIS IS ONE EXPLANATION (%HESITATION) THEY CERTAINLY (%HESITATION) WERE MOSTLY PROFESSIONALS LIKE THE REDEEMERS THEY WERE LIKE MOST AMERICAN POLITICIAN MOST OF YOU KNOW WHAT PROFESSION THAT IS THAT WAS LAWYERS AND STILL IS TO A VERY (%HESITATION) LARGE EXTENT (%HESITATION) (M-) THEY WERE CERTAINLY BETTER EDUCATED (%HESITATION) THAN MOST SOUTHERNERS THEY HAD (%HESITATION) LESS MONEY BUT THEY WERE NOT POOR (%HESITATION) POOR FOLKS DO NOT HAVE TIME BE IN POLITICS THE IDEA THAT SCALAWAGS WERE POOR WHITE TRASH IS ABSURD (%HESITATION) THOSE THAT WERE VERY POOR HAD TO SPEND ALL THEIR TIME (%HESITATION) JUST TRYING TO MAKE (%HESITATION) ENOUGH TO HOLD LIFE (%HESITATION) TOGETHER (%HESITATION) HERE THE ALABAMA AND LOUISIANA SCALAWAGS COMPARE WELL WITH SCALAWAGS (%HESITATION) WITH THE REDEEMERS IN THOSE STATES ABOUT EQUAL ESTATES IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY I LOOKED AT THE CENSUS RECORDS IN NORTH CAROLINA INDEED THE SCALAWAGS OF NORTH CAROLINA WERE RICHER THAN THE SCALAWAGS IN EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT IS QUITE AMAZING (%HESITATION) BUT THE REDEEMERS IN NORTH CAROLINA WERE EVEN WEALTHIER THAN THAT QUITE A BIT WEALTHIER THAN THAT WHAT ABOUT SECESSION OR MAYBE I SHOULD MENTION PARTY AFFILIATION FIRST BECAUSE THIS HAS PLAYED (%HESITATION) A BIG ROLE WITH SCHOLARS (%HESITATION) SCHOLARS LIKE DAVID DONALD THOUGHT THAT ALL THE SCALAWAGS WERE WHIGS BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE HAS (C-) DISCOVERED IN (%HESITATION) MISSISSIPPI WITH A VERY IMPORTANT ARTICLE BACK (%HESITATION) IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES WELL IN THE UPPER SOUTH MOST OF THEM WERE WHIGS INDEED IN THE UPPER SOUTH MOST OF THE REDEEMERS AND THE SCALAWAGS HAD BEEN WHIGS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WERE LARGELY REPUDIATED FOR A WHILE ANYWAY (%HESITATION) SO IN THE UPPER SOUTH IT IS CLEAR IN TENNESSEE THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHIGS (%HESITATION) YOU WILL FIND THAT (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) WELL OVER EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE EARLY REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE HAD BELONGED TO THE WHIG PARTY SO IT IS (F-) FAIRLY EASY AS I INDICATED IN TENNESSEE THE REPUBLICANS REPLACED THE WHIGS AS A AS A PARTY (%HESITATION) IN THIS STATE IN THE LOWER SOUTH THOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE (%HESITATION) THEY WERE ABOUT EVENLY DIVIDED (%HESITATION) SOUTH CAROLINA WAS ALREADY A ONE PARTY STATE SO THAT THREW IT A LITTLE BIT TOWARD THE DEMOCRATS BUT (%HESITATION) LARGELY THEY WERE EVENLY DIVIDED IN THE LOWER SOUTH ALTHOUGH I DID FIND THAT DAVID DONALD WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ABOUT MISSISSIPPI MOST OF THE MISSISSIPPI SCALAWAGS WERE (%HESITATION) FORMERLY (%HESITATION) WHIGS WHAT ABOUT SECESSION OVER NINETY PER CENT OF THE SCALAWAGS OPPOSED SECESSION MOST OF THESE CONTINUED TO OPPOSE SECESSION AFTER LINCOLN'S ELECTION THAT COMPARES WITH FEWER THAN FORTY PER CENT OF THE REDEEMERS AND WITH THE REDEEMERS MOST OF THEM IF THEY DID OPPOSED IT THEY OPPOSED (D-) IT TO UP TO LINCOLN'S ELECTION AND GAVE WAY (%HESITATION) THEREAFTER IT IS AMAZING HOW MANY SCALAWAGS SERVED IN THE UNION ARMY MANY OF YOU KNOW FROM TENNESSEE THIRTY THOUSAND THAT IS ONLY IN TENNESSEE UNITS THAT DOES NOT REGARD KENTUCKY UNITS WHEN THEY WENT OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND JOINED A KENTUCKY UNIT OR MANY OF THEM JOINED INDIANA UNITS THEY WERE (P-) PLENTIFUL OF COURSE IF YOU COMPARE THAT WITH THE REDEEMERS (%HESITATION) OR YOU COMPARE THE CONFEDERATES NO YOU PROBABLY HAVE WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND (%HESITATION) WHEN YOU LOOK AT (%HESITATION) THE REDEEMERS BUT THIRTY THOUSAND IS A RATHER SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNION SOLDIERS (%HESITATION) FROM (%HESITATION) FROM THIS STATE MANY SCALAWAGS SUPPORTED (%HESITATION) THE PEACE PARTY IN NORTH CAROLINA ONE SCHOLAR HAS PROVEN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A VERY VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO PEACE PARTY SUPPORTERS AND (%HESITATION) AND THOSE WHO BECAME SCALAWAGS THEY WERE REALLY THE EMBRYO THAT PARTY WAS THE EMBRYO OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (%HESITATION) IN NORTH CAROLINA THEY WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN GEORGIA WHERE (Y-) (%HESITATION) JOSHUA HILL (%HESITATION) LED THE TICKET AGAINST JOE BROWN (%HESITATION) HE LOST BUT (%HESITATION) HE DID (%HESITATION) LATER BECOME VERY IMPORTANT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN GEORGIA (%HESITATION) THE UNIONIST UNDERGROUNDS EVERYWHERE I FOUND A UNIONIST UNDERGROUND AND MANY SCHOLARS ARE STILL WORKING IN THIS (%HESITATION) (H-) (I-) (I-) (U-) (I-) (I-) (U-) YOU WILL FIND A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT UNDERGROUND WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED (%HESITATION) WERE LATER REPUBLICANS (R-) AND REFUGEES I MENTIONED THOSE THEY WERE LARGE IN NUMBER AND THEY WENT NOT ONLY TO THE NORTH BUT THEY WENT TO CITIES OF REFUGE (%HESITATION) USING THE BIBLICAL TERM THERE (%HESITATION) IN THE SOUTH ALSO IN CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS FOUR STATES UNDERWENT (%HESITATION) WAR TIME RECONSTRUCTION TENNESSEE ARKANSAS LOUISIANA AND VIRGINIA THE DELEGATES TO THOSE CONVENTIONS MOST OF THEM BECAME (%HESITATION) REPUBLICANS NOW LET US LOOK A LITTLE BIT AT THE POSTWAR YEARS DURING THE POSTWAR YEARS (%HESITATION) THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HAD BEEN UNIONISTS WERE GREATLY DISILLUSIONED (%HESITATION) AFTER ALL THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD WON (%HESITATION) BUT (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) THE PICTURE WAS NOT ALL THAT CLEAR THEY HAD BEEN ON THE WINNING SIDE LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY THEY HAD NOT EXACTLY WON THEY DID NOT GAIN GREATER STATUS AND GREATER (PE-) (%HESITATION) PRESTIGE FOR NOT BEING GUNG HO (%HESITATION) CONFEDERATES (%HESITATION) DURING THE WAR THERE WAS FEAR OF CONFEDERATES ON THE PART OF THE UNIONISTS AND THIS DROVE SOME OF THEM IN (R-) (%HESITATION) INTO (%HESITATION) THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IT FIRST DROVE THEM TO ACCEPTING BLACK SUFFRAGE I MIGHT MENTION THIS BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE OUT THIS FACT THAT CONSERVATIVES ALSO ACCEPTED BLACK SUFFRAGE AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY FOUND OUT THEY (S-) THEY NEEDED THOSE VOTES BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE ONE WOULD ACCEPT SOME BLACK LEADERSHIP ONE WOULD ACCEPT SOME CRUMBS AT LEAST FROM THE TABLE FOR THE BLACKS (%HESITATION) BUT THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD NOT THEY WOULD ACCEPT THEIR VOTES BUT THEY DID NOT WANT (%HESITATION) YOU KNOW ANY ANY PART OF THEM HAVING LEADERSHIP (%HESITATION) WITHIN THE PARTY THERE WERE CERTAIN AGENCIES FOR PARTY BUILDING (%HESITATION) AFTER THE WAR AGENCIES SUCH AS THE UNION LEAGUE (%HESITATION) NEWSPAPERS LOYAL NEWSPAPERS NORTHERN DENOMINATIONS SOME FREEDMAN BUREAU OFFICIALS ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM WERE RACIST (%HESITATION) AND (%HESITATION) THERE WAS A TWO WAY PULL YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS NOT JUST (%HESITATION) WHAT EVER ATTRACTS BUT ALSO WHAT IS EXPELLING AND THAT TWO WAY PULL HAD TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF IT WAS GOING TO BUILD (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) LOYAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE SOUTH HAD TO HAVE OFFICEHOLDERS (%HESITATION) SO THIS IS ALMOST A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY IN A WAY THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO BE (%HESITATION) THE SCALAWAGS IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDED OFFICEHOLDERS AND THEY NEEDED PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT BEEN DISLOYAL (%HESITATION) TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SO NATURALLY THIS GROUP WAS GOING TO BE ATTRACTED OR PULLED (%HESITATION) TOWARD THE RULING PARTY IN THE NORTH NOW WHAT WERE SOME OF THE PREDISPOSING FACTORS THAT I HAVE MENTIONED THE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THIS FACTOR IS MENTIONED THE MORE LIKELY THIS PERSON BECAME A REPUBLICAN A DEMOCRAT WHO OPPOSED SECESSION A WHIG WHO OPPOSED SECESSION A PERSON WHO VOTED AGAINST SECESSION A PASSIVE WAR TIME UNIONIST A PEACE PARTY ADVOCATE AN ACTIVE WAR TIME UNIONIST AND A POST UNION PARTY SUPPORTER NOW THE MORE OF THOSE YOU HAVE OR THE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE YOU HAVE THEM THEN THE MORE LIKELY THEY WERE PREDISPOSED %HESITATION TO BEING REPUBLICANS BUT YOU CAN BE PREDISPOSED (%HESITATION) WITH OUT ACTUALLY EVER DOING ANYTHING WE KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PREDISPOSED WITH OUT ACTING ON IT SO IT TOOK OTHER FACTORS WHAT MOTIVATED THEM I WILL MENTION JUST A FEW ALL OF THEM SAID THEY WERE FOR REUNION THIS WAS WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT AND THE CONGRESS HAD TAKEN THE SOUTHERN STATES OUT OF THE UNION (%HESITATION) WITH THE RECONSTRUCTION ACTS I THINK THEY WERE MOSTLY OUT FOR SELF PROTECTION THEY FELT THEY HAD BEEN PERSECUTED SO THEY HAD FEELINGS OF PERSECUTION AND THEY WANTED TO JOIN A PARTY THAT WAS CONTROLLED (%HESITATION) WHO CONTROLLED THE NATION SOME OF THEM WANTED CONTROL OF THE PARTY MAKE IT PURER (%HESITATION) GET RID OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE CARPETBAGGERS THIS MOTIVATED SOME OF THEM SOME OF THEM NORTHERN BIRTH THAT PLAYED A BIG ROLE WERE THEY IDEALISTIC WHEN IT CAME TO RACE MOST OF THEM WERE NOT BUT THEY WILLING TO JOIN HANDS WITH OTHERS JUST AS PEOPLE ARE TODAY WILLING TO JOIN HANDS WITH PEOPLE WHO DIFFERED WITH THEM IN A PARTY TO GET SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO GET IT ACCOMPLISHED IS THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR PARTY MANY SAID THEY WERE A PARTY OF PROGRESS THESE WORDS WERE REFLECTED IN OSBORNE A. LOCKERIDGE %HESITATION A POETIC IRISHMAN WHO SAID (%HESITATION) SPEAKING OF PROGRESS HE SAID WE MUST BE MEN NOT MONUMENTS LET NOT PRIDE PREJUDICE AND FOLLY BLIND US AND LEAD US STUMBLING BACKWARDS OVER A WILDERNESS OF GRAVES THANK YOU

20031206_163852_cspan_eng 1 elizabeth_h_varon 1214.865000 1615.997000 HI TODAY I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE REMARKABLE STORY OF ELIZABETH VAN LEW AS THE PITHY TITLE OF MY BOOK SUGGESTS SHE WAS A SOUTHERN LADY AND A YANKEE SPY A RICHMOND WOMAN ELITE WHITE WOMAN WHO SPIED FOR THE UNION DURING THE CIVIL WAR BORN IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN ELIZABETH VAN LEW LIVED A LONG AND IMPROBABLE LIFE NOT ONLY WAS SHE A YANKEE SPY SHE WAS ALSO A PIONEERING FEMALE POLITICIAN AFTER THE WAR A SCALAWAG AND A SOUTHERN SUFFRAGIST AS I EMBARKED ON THIS PROJECT I HAD TO CONFRONT THE FACT THAT THOUGH VAN LEW'S LIFE IS VERY RICH SHE IS IN SOME WAYS AN AWKWARD SUBJECT FOR A BIOGRAPHY WHY WELL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HER IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HER %HESITATION DO NOT BE ASHAMED MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT SHE IS AN OBSCURE FIGURE TO MOST AMERICANS AT THE SAME TIME THOSE CIVIL WAR BUFFS AND VIRGINIANS WHO KNOW OF HER VIEW HER THROUGH THE PRISM OF A VERY DISTORTING MYTH THE MYTH OF CRAZY BET ACCORDING TO THIS MYTH IT WAS WELL KNOWN IN WAR TIME RICHMOND THAT ELIZABETH VAN LEW SYMPATHIZED WITH THE UNION BUT SHE (INV-) AVOIDED INCARCERATION FOR DISLOYALTY BECAUSE SHE PRETENDED TO BE CRAZY CRAFTED A REPUTATION AS AN IMBALANCED AND THEREFORE ESSENTIALLY HARMLESS ECCENTRIC OLD SPINSTER HENCE CONTEMPORARIES KNEW HER AND SHE HAS BEEN REMEMBERED AS CRAZY BET NOW MANY A SCHOLARLY TREATMENT OF VAN LEW OVER THE YEARS HAS SUGGESTED THAT THIS ROLE OF CRAZY BET CAME EASY TO HER BECAUSE SHE WAS IN FACT AN ODD AND PECULIAR WOMAN IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF MY BOOK I AM GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT (%HESITATION) FOUR KEY THEMES IN VAN LEW'S LIFE HER VIEWS ON SLAVERY HER MOTIVATIONS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HER SPY NETWORK THE REAL REASON WHY SHE WAS NEVER CAUGHT BY THE CONFEDERATES AND THE NATURE OF HER POSTWAR POLITICAL CAREER AS A SCALAWAG THE CENTRAL ASSERTION OF MY BOOK IS THAT IN VAN LEW'S (CATH-) CASE TRUTH IS NOT ONLY STRANGER THAN FICTION STRANGER THAN THE MYTH BUT MORE INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT AS WELL SO VAN LEW'S (%HESITATION) MOTIVATIONS FIRST ACCORDING TO THE (%HESITATION) CRAZY BET MYTH VAN LEW WAS AN ABOLITIONIST SOMEONE WHO FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD KNEW SLAVERY WAS WRONG AND COMMITTED HERSELF TO EMANCIPATION NOW FOR VAN LEW'S DETRACTORS FOR PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONFEDERACY TO CALL HER AN ABOLITIONIST WAS TO BRAND HER AS AN OUTSIDER TO THE SOUTH AS SOMEONE WHO BECAUSE HER PARENTS WERE NORTHERNERS AND BECAUSE SHE HELD HERETICAL VIEWS WAS NOT A REAL VIRGINIAN I TAKE GREAT PAINS IN MY BOOK TO ARGUE THAT VAN LEW WAS NOT AN ABOLITIONIST NOT IN THE SENSE IN WHICH WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON OR FREDERICK DOUGLASS WERE ABOLITIONISTS INSTEAD OF REJECTING SLAVERY AND THE COMPANY OF SLAVE HOLDERS VAN LEW AND HER FAMILY CAREFULLY STAKED OUT A POSITION ON A (S-) TENUOUS MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THE PROSLAVERY CREED ON THE ONE HAND AND ABOLITIONISM ON THE OTHER THE VAN LEWS LIVED IN A MANSION IN RICHMOND'S MOST ELEGANT NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY MADE EVERY EFFORT THOUGH HER PARENTS AGAIN WERE FROM THE NORTH TO FULLY ASSIMILATE INTO SOUTHERN SOCIETY INDEED THEY OWNED DOZENS OF SLAVES DURING THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD AT THE SAME TIME THAT HER FAMILY HELD BLACKS IN BONDAGE ELIZABETH VAN LEW AND HER MOTHER ELIZA HER (H-) (%HESITATION) PARTNER IN HER UNIONIST WORK LAMENTED THE EVILS OF SLAVERY HOPING ALL THE WHILE THAT THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF KINDNESS AND CHARITY AND MANUMISSION THEY COULD ERODE SLAVERY GRADUALLY FROM THE INSIDE THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THREE VAN LEW GAVE SOME OF THE FAMILY SLAVES A SORT OF SECRET FREEDOM BUT THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT THE FAMILY RETAINED DE JURE OWNERSHIP OF SLAVES INTO THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES AND EVEN INTO THE EARLY YEARS OF THE WAR NOW VAN LEW'S STUBBORN BELIEF IN A GRADUAL VOLUNTARY EMANCIPATION WAS NO NORTHERN HERESY RATHER IT WAS A DISTINCTLY VIRGINIAN OUTLOOK AND THIS IN SOME WAYS IS THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING VAN LEW'S LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE HERSELF AS SOMEONE WHO REPUDIATED AND BETRAYED THE SOUTH RATHER SHE BELIEVED THAT SECESSIONISTS CONFEDERATES WERE THE TRAITORS TO THE SOUTH IT WAS THEY WHO IN THE WAKE OF LINCOLN'S EIGHTEEN SIXTY ELECTION ABANDONED VIRGINIA'S HERITAGE OF POLITICAL MODERATION IT WAS THEY WHO REJECTED REFORM AND COMPROMISE AND BECAME (B-) BLINDED BY THEIR VIRULENT PROSLAVERY CREED SECESSION REPRESENTED FOR VAN LEW IN OTHER WORDS A CATASTROPHE AND AN EPIPHANY SHE DID EVENTUALLY ELABORATE A SOPHISTICATED AND (M-) MORALLY POWERFUL CRITIQUE OF SLAVERY BUT THAT CRITIQUE OF SLAVERY WHICH IS PRESERVED IN HER JOURNAL WAS FORGED IN THE FIRESTORM OF SECESSION SLAVERY SHE CAME TO CONCLUDE BY THE EVE OF THE CIVIL WAR HAD MADE SOUTHERN WHITES ANTI DEMOCRATIC COERCIVE INTELLECTUALLY BACKWARD AND DANGEROUSLY SELF RIGHTEOUS AND ARROGANT SLAVERY IN VAN LEW'S RECKONING WAS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MADNESS THE EVIL OF SECESSION VAN LEW'S ESTRANGEMENTS FROM (PUL-) PROSLAVERY WHITES IN RICHMOND DEEPENED HER EMPATHY (W-) WITH AND EVEN IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CITY'S BLACKS NOT LONG AFTER SECESSION VAN LEW WROTE IN HER DIARY THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE ONE OF THE FAMILY SERVANTS HAD PREDICTED THE DOWNFALL OF THE CONFEDERACY TELLING HER QUOTE YOU WILL SEE THEY SHALL FALL DOWN SLAIN THAT IS THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY UNQUOTE VAN LEW FOLLOWED THIS WITH A BRIEF AND EMPATHETIC POSTSCRIPT SHE WROTE SO SAID WITH CLEAR EYE AND BRIGHT HOPE THE INTELLIGENT COLORED MAN WILLIAM ROANE THAT CALLED US OWNERS UNQUOTE VAN LEW SHARED ROANE'S BRIGHT HOPE AND LOOKED TO THE UNION ARMY TO FULFILL HIS PROPHECY THUS IT WAS ONLY AFTER SECESSION CLOSED OFF THE MIDDLE GROUND DASHING HER HOPE THAT THE WHITE SOUTH MIGHT REFORM ITSELF THAT ELIZABETH EMBRACED ABOLITION SHE CHOSE TO STAY IN RICHMOND DURING THE WAR AND AFTER AND THIS IS THE MOST (P-) SALIENT FACT OF HER LIFE IF SHE HAD LEFT RICHMOND THERE WOULD BE NO STORY RIGHT SHE CHOSE TO STAY WHEN SHE HAD COULD HAVE EASILY DECAMPED TO THE NORTH WHERE SHE HAD RELATIVES SHE CHOSE TO STAY BECAUSE SHE FELT SHE HAD AN AWFUL RESPONSIBILITY AS SHE PUT IT TO HER FELLOW VIRGINIANS AND PARTICULARLY TO THE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN HER ORBIT VAN LEW IN SHORT WAS NOT BORN AND RAISED AN ABOLITIONIST BUT EVOLVED INTO ONE NOW THE WAR CAME HOW WAS VAN LEW TO FULFILL THE AWFUL RESPONSIBILITY THAT SHE FELT SHE FULFILLED IT BY COMMITTING HERSELF TO SOME TERRIBLY DANGEROUS BUT IMPORTANT WORK THE UNION UNDERGROUND THAT COALESCED UNDER VAN LEW'S LEADERSHIP IN THE FIRST YEARS OF THE WAR PROVIDED RELIEF AND MEANS OF ESCAPE FOR UNION SOLDIERS IMPRISONED IN RICHMOND AS WELL AS HELPING CIVILIANS BLACK AND WHITE SOUTHERN CIVILIANS FLEE THE CONFEDERACY AND FIND REFUGE IN THE NORTH THE MAIN WEAPONS IN VAN LEW'S UNIONIST ARSENAL WERE FIRST OF ALL HER FAMILY'S WEALTH WHICH SHE (S-) SPENT LIBERALLY TO BRIBE CONFEDERATE OFFICIALS HER FAMILY'S SOCIAL STANDING WHICH SHE PARLAYED INTO NUMEROUS FAVORS FROM INFLUENTIAL CONFEDERATES AND HER PENCHANT FOR PLAY ACTING

20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 589.314000 609.421000 BUT EVEN HERE IN LARGELY CONSERVATIVE CENTRALIA WHICH HELPED PRESIDENT BUSH WIN WASHINGTON STATE'S THIRD DISTRICT IN TWO THOUSAND SOME HAVE QUESTIONED THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS IN IRAQ THE THIRD DISTRICT IS REPRESENTED IN CONGRESS BY DEMOCRAT BRIAN BAIRD HE OPPOSED GOING TO WAR AND HAS CRITICIZED POSTWAR STRATEGY
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 brian_baird 609.421000 610.845000 I AM SAD ABOUT IT (%HESITATION)
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 610.845000 629.143000 CONGRESSMAN BAIRD HOSTED A TOWN HALL MEETING LAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND IT APPEARED MANY OF THE TOWN'S REPUBLICANS STAYED HOME THOSE WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT IRAQ WERE VERY CRITICAL RICK STRAW FOCUSED ON THE EFFECT OF THE WAR AT BAIRD ABOUT REPORTS THAT THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND RESERVISTS ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAKING ENDS MEET
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 rick_straw 629.143000 641.758000 I AM WONDERING IF ANYTHING IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE TO FOR THOSE GUYS WHO ARE WHO ARE DOING THE SERVICE FOR US AND INSTEAD OF PENALIZING THEM THIS %HESITATION TO MY MIND VERY DISASTROUSLY
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 brian_baird 641.758000 663.803000 (W-) WE HAVE INCREASINGLY PLACED THE BURDEN OF FIGHTING OUR WARS AND DOING OUR DEFENSE ON GUARDSMEN AND RESERVISTS WE FIXED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER (B-) EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE WE FIXED THIS NONSENSE OF HAVING TO PAY FOR YOUR MEALS WHILE YOU ARE AT WALTER REED YOU KNOW THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU GET OUT OF THE (HOS-) FOR YOUR MEALS WHILE YOU WERE THERE AND YOU ARE A SOLDIER YOU YOU (%HESITATION) SO WE FIXED THAT
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 663.803000 671.816000 BOTH STEPHEN BARLOW AND BERNIE MEYER SAID SUCH HARDSHIPS BUTTRESS THEIR CONCLUSION THAT THE IRAQ WAR HAS BEEN A DIRE MISTAKE
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 stephen_barlow 671.816000 681.376000 WE ARE IN A WAR THAT WAS (N-) NOT NECESSARY THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AND I THINK THIS IS TO ME CATASTROPHE FOR THIS COUNTRY
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 bernie_meyer 681.376000 692.656000 I JUST THINK WE ARE BUNGLING IT AND AND AND WE ARE CREATING MORE ENEMIES ACROSS THE WORLD THAN FRIENDS AND AND I DO NOT WANT MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO GROW UP IN THIS WORLD (A-) THE WAY IT IS GOING
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 brian_baird 692.656000 717.198000 THIS IS WHAT I HEAR INTERNATIONALLY THEY HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS A I THINK A LONG TERM DANGER THAT I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HEARS IT I HEAR IT ALL THE TIME IT IS NOT YOU IT IS NOT (WE) DO NOT TRUST THIS GUY EVEN IF YOU GO IN WITH GOOD INTENTIONS AND EVEN IF YOU (A-) ASSUME GOOD INTENTIONS ON THE PRESIDENT'S PART IF HE DOES NOT HAVE THE IT THE RISKS TO OUR COUNTRY OVER THE LONG HAUL ARE GREAT
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 717.198000 731.617000 BUT BACK OUT ON CENTRALIA'S MAIN STREET TODD CHAPUT'S VIEW WAS FAR (DIFF-) RESIDENTS GENERALLY FEEL THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO ACT LARGELY UNILATERALLY AND PREEMPTIVELY EVEN IF DOING SO UPSET U. S. ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 todd_chaput 731.617000 754.806000 THE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS WENT TO THE DOCTOR WHEN HE GOT SICK WELL WHY NOT TAKE CARE OF THE THING BEFORE IT HAPPENS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE (%HESITATION) I COULD I CAN SEE THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT AND IT AND IT MAKE DOES MAKE SOME SENSE IF THE THREAT IS THERE OR THE POTENTIAL OF THE THREAT IS THERE WHY NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MILITARILY I THINK AT FIRST BUT WHY NOT TRY TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT EVER ESCALATES INTO A REAL PROBLEM
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 754.806000 766.602000 DAN DUFFY AGREED HE SAID HE HAD HOPED WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND BY NOW BUT SAID HIS BELIEF THAT IRAQ HAD A ROLE AS A TERROR TRAINING CAMP WAS REASON ENOUGH TO LAUNCH THE INVASION
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 dan_duffy 766.602000 775.066000 THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT FIND THEM DOES NOT NEGATE THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE HAD TO TRY TO AND I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE IT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN GENERATED FROM
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 775.066000 781.583000 SO YOU (%HESITATION) AGREED WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT IT WAS PART OF THE WAR ON TERRORISM TO INVADE IRAQ
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 dan_duffy 781.583000 785.799000 I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE CORRECT I AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT HUNDRED PER CENT
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 785.799000 788.768000 CONGRESSMAN BAIRD DISPUTED THOSE THEORIES
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 brian_baird 788.768000 812.054000 I AM NOT SURE THAT IT IS LEGITIMATE TO SAY THAT (%HESITATION) IRAQ IS OF THE WAR ON TERROR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WHERE THE TERRORISTS ORIGINATED NOT A SINGLE TERRORIST CAME FROM IRAQ AND WE DID NOT PREEMPT ANYTHING SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD NO REAL CAPACITY TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IF HE HAD HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE THING IF HE HAD HAD BIOCHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE THING BUT HE DID NOT SO I VERY MUCH RESPECT THEIR OPINION I I DO NOT SHARE IT
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 bob_gunther 812.054000 813.447000 WE CAME OUT HERE BECAUSE
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 kwame_holman 813.447000 831.455000 ONE OF CONGRESSMAN BAIRD'S BIGGEST SUPPORTERS IN CENTRALIA IS BOB GUNTHER A VIET NAM VETERAN AND THIRTY YEAR UNION LEADER AT THE TRANSALTA COAL PLANT ALTHOUGH HE STAUNCHLY SUPPORTS THE TROOPS GUNTHER SAYS THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE LEAD UP TO WAR
20031209_193946_pbs_eng 1 bob_gunther 831.455000 861.923000 I FEEL KIND OF BETRAYED I DO I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW (%HESITATION) WHAT LITTLE I KNEW I WOULD THINK THAT THE LEADERS OF THIS COUNTRY WOULD HAVE KNOWN A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN I DO BUT IN THIS (%HESITATION) INSTANCE HERE WITH THIS IRAQI WAR WE ARE THERE WE GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND WE HAVE GOT TO SUPPORT (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION) THE DECISIONS BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE CAN NOT QUESTION THE DECISIONS BEFORE THEY ARE BEFORE THEY ARE MADE OR EVEN AFTER THEY ARE MADE

20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 speaker_23 906.642000 915.863000 A LOT OF THE OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THIS SIX TO NINE MONTH RECOVERY DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SIX TO NINE MONTHS OF GROWTH RIGHT BEHIND IT
20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 brian_williams 915.863000 920.784000 STILL YOU CAN TELL THEY ARE VERY MUCH READY TO CELEBRATE IN ATLANTA

20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 robert_hormats 958.116000 970.911000 THEY CERTAINLY ARE THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF RETAILERS PARTICULARLY IN THE TOY BUSINESS AND (%HESITATION) BUSINESSES THAT REALLY DEPEND ON CHRISTMAS OR PRE CHRISTMAS SALES TO DO WELL IT COULD REALLY AFFECT THEIR WHOLE YEAR (%HESITATION) AND AND FOR MANY IT DOES
20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 tom_costello 970.911000 972.739000 AND WHAT IS IT LOOKING LIKE FOR THEM THUS FAR
20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 robert_hormats 972.739000 999.767000 SO FAR IT IS HARD TO TELL IT LOOKED REASONABLY GOOD JUST AFTER THANKSGIVING BUT YOU REALLY CAN NOT TELL IN THE END SHOPPERS ARE VERY SMART AND THEY TEND TO WAIT UNTIL THE VERY (%HESITATION) LAST DAY IF THEY THINK THEY CAN GET BARGAINS THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF SHOPPING ON THE INTERNET MORE AND MORE THIS YEAR THAN THAN IN THE PAST AND THAT IS REALLY HARD AT THIS POINT TO QUANTIFY BUT I WAS IN A TOYS R. US TODAY AND IT LOOKED QUITE (%HESITATION) BUSTLING AND I I THINK YOU PROBABLY ARE SEEING THAT ELSEWHERE AND THIS WAS IN NEW YORK
20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 tom_costello 999.767000 1011.043000 NOW LET US PICK UP ON BRIAN'S PIECE AS WELL BECAUSE VIRTUALLY ALL THE ECONOMIC DATA FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER INDICATES THAT WE ARE IN A VERY STRONG RECOVERY THIRD QUARTER WAS VERY STRONG AS WELL DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE INTO TWO THOUSAND FOUR

D. P. BUT JOBS ARE LAGGING BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT HOW SUSTAINABLE THIS IS PRODUCTIVITY HAS INCREASED VERY DRAMATICALLY SO YOU CAN PRODUCE MORE GOODS WITH FEWER PEOPLE THAN THAN IN THE PAST AND (%HESITATION) THERE ARE (%HESITATION) SOME JOBS THAT ARE GOING ABROAD SO JOBS IS THE LAGGING ELEMENT HERE
20031219_202502_cnbc_eng 1 tom_costello 1051.945000 1058.727000 YEAH IN FACT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL AT SIX PER CENT AND THE CONCERN ALL ALONG HAS BEEN THAT WE ARE IN A JOBLESS RECOVERY TO SOME EXTENT
